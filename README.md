# India-Temp-Data
This dataset includes temperature data seen in India from years 1900 to 2011.It consists of a total of 111 entries and 6 columns namely- Year, Annual, Jan-Feb, Mar-May, Jun-Sept, Oct-Dec. We can see better data patterns arising in different times of the year  by looking at the various seasons in a year. 
Analysis of the dataset includes line plots for the columns, heatmap (to see the correlations), box plots and distribution curve to check outliers.
This data can be used to analyse changing temperature patterns in India and when exactly the data started showing early signs of it.
The dataset is available for free access at the Open Government Platform India (https://data.gov.in/). TROP ICSU does not claim any rights over the dataset.
